Key changes:

- 4 plots initially in "figure" directory have been deleted and plots for the assignment are placed directly in the master branch
- R Codes for each of the plots are presented separately

IMPORTANT NOTE: The plot backgrounds are intentionally "transparent" as they mirror the original plots in the repo; a simple bg="white" within the png() call will yield a result as seen on the course website (but pngs with transparent backgrounds would perhaps render to appear with white backgrounds on most websites, so that may not be required.) We've had a pretty long discussion on this in the Discussion Forums here (https://class.coursera.org/exdata-011/forum/thread?thread_id=24). 
Hopefully this has no impact on the grading.

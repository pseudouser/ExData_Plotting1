Key changes:

- 4 plots initially in "figure" directory have been deleted and plots for the assignment are placed directly in the master branch
- R Codes for each of the plots are presented separately

IMPORTANT NOTE: The plot backgrounds are intentionally "transparent" as they mirror the origincal plots in the repo; a simple bg="white" within the png() call will yield a result as seen on the course website (but pngs with transparent backgrounds would perhaps render to appear with white backgrounds on most websites, so that may not be required.)
